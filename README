purple-dbus-regrowler
=====================

This is a python project that growls messages from pidgin by looking into dbus.

Required modules
================

dbus (debian/ubuntu: python-dbus)
netgrowl (http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Projects/netgrowl)

To install
==========

0. Check out the code
1. Install python-dbus
2. Copy netgrowl.py into the same directory (or into your PYTHONPATH)
3. execute `python purple-dbus-regrowler.py`

purple-dbus-regrowler.py still runs in the foreground, so it's probably a good thing to put it in a screen.
